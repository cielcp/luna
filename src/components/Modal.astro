        Hi there! I’m Lunabot, your AI support companion. My goal is to help you
        explore and practice Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, guiding
        you through exercises and offering support on anything you want to chat
        about. <br /><br /> Please remember: While I’m designed to offer support
        and help you develop skills based on CBT principles, I’m not a substitute
        for professional therapy. For a comprehensive treatment plan, please consult
        a licensed mental health professional.

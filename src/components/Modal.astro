      Hi there! I’m LunaBot, your AI support companion. My goal is to help you
      explore and practice Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, guiding you
      through exercises and offering support on anything you want to chat about.

      Please remember: While I’m designed to offer support and help you develop
      skills based on CBT principles, I’m not a substitute for professional
      therapy. For a comprehensive treatment plan, please consult a licensed
      mental health professional.
